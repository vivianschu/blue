# Welcome to the He Lab

The He laboratory applies a variety of genomic, epigenomic experimental and computational approaches to elucidate the functional role of epigenetic regulation in cancer development, progression and drug response, with a special focus on the interplay between epigenetic regulator and noncoding RNA. Combine the experimental and computational expertise, we are in a unique position to make major contributions to both the general understanding of cancer biology and the improvement of epigenetic therapy.
